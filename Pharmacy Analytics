CVS Health is trying to better understand its pharmacy sales, and how well different products are selling. Each drug can only be produced by one manufacturer.

Write a query to find the top 3 most profitable drugs sold, and how much profit they made. Assume that there are no ties in the profits. Display the result from the highest to the lowest total profit.

Definition:

cogs stands for Cost of Goods Sold which is the direct cost associated with producing the drug.
Total Profit = Total Sales - Cost of Goods Sold

pharmacy_sales Table:
Column Name	  Type
product_id	  integer
units_sold	  integer
total_sales	  decimal
cogs	        decimal
manufacturer	varchar
drug	        varchar


SELECT 
  drug,
  total_sales - cogs AS total_profit
FROM 
  pharmacy_sales
ORDER BY
  total_profit DESC
  LIMIT 3;
  
  Output

drug	     total_profit
Humira	   81515652.55
Keytruda	 11622022.02
Dupixent	 11217052.34

CVS Health is trying to better understand its pharmacy sales, and how well different products are selling. Each drug can only be produced by one manufacturer.

Write a query to find out which manufacturer is associated with the drugs that were not profitable and how much money CVS lost on these drugs. 

Output the manufacturer, number of drugs and total losses. Total losses should be in absolute value. Display the results with the highest losses on top.

SELECT 
  manufacturer,
  COUNT(drug) AS Num_of_Drugs,
  ABS(SUM(total_sales - cogs)) AS total_loss
FROM 
  pharmacy_sales
WHERE 
  total_sales - cogs <=0
GROUP BY
  manufacturer,
  total_loss
ORDER BY
  total_loss DESC
  
Output

manufacturer	       num_of_drugs	    total_loss
Johnson & Johnson   	6             	894913.13
Eli Lilly	            4	              447352.90

CVS Health is trying to better understand its pharmacy sales, and how well different products are selling. Each drug can only be produced by one manufacturer.

Write a query to find the total sales of drugs for each manufacturer. Round your answer to the closest million, and report your results in descending order of total sales.

Because this data is being directly fed into a dashboard which is being seen by business stakeholders, format your result like this: "$36 million".


SELECT 
  manufacturer,
  CONCAT('$',ROUND(SUM(total_sales)/1000000),' ','million') AS sale
FROM 
  pharmacy_sales
GROUP BY
  manufacturer
ORDER BY
  SUM(total_sales) DESC
  
  Output

manufacturer	      sale
AbbVie	            $114 million
Eli Lilly	          $82 million
Biogen	            $70 million
Johnson & Johnson	  $43 million
Bayer	              $34 million
AstraZeneca       	$32 million
Pfizer	            $28 million
Merck	              $27 million
Novartis	          $26 million
Sanofi	            $25 million
Roche               $16 million
GlaxoSmithKline     $4 million
