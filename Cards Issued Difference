Your team at JPMorgan Chase is soon launching a new credit card, and to gain some context, you are analyzing how many credit cards were issued each month.

Write a query that outputs the name of each credit card and the difference in issued amount between the month with the most cards issued, and the least cards issued. Order the results according to the biggest difference.

monthly_cards_issued Table:
Column Name	     Type
issue_month	     integer
issue_year	     integer
card_name	       string
issued_amount	   integer



SELECT 
  card_name,
  MAX(issued_amount)-MIN(issued_amount) AS Difference
FROM 
  monthly_cards_issued
GROUP BY
  card_name
ORDER BY
  Difference DESC
  
  Output

card_name	                  difference
Chase Sapphire Reserve	    30000
Chase Freedom Flex	        15000
