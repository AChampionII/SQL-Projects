Assume you have an events table on app analytics. Write a query to get the appâ€™s click-through rate (CTR %) in 2022. Output the results in percentages rounded to 2 decimal places.

Notes:

Percentage of click-through rate = 100.0 * Number of clicks / Number of impressions
To avoid integer division, you should multiply the click-through rate by 100.0, not 100.

events Table:
Column Name	  Type
app_id	      integer
event_type	  string
timestamp	    datetime


SELECT 
  app_id,
  ROUND(100.0 *
    SUM(CASE
      WHEN event_type = 'click'
        THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) 
        /
    SUM(CASE
      WHEN event_type = 'impression'
      THEN 1 ELSE 0 END),2) AS ctr_rate
FROM 
  events
WHERE
  timestamp BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY
  app_id;
  
  Output

app_id	ctr_rate
123	    66.67
234	    33.33
