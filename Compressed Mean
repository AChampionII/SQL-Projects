You are trying to find the mean number of items bought per order on Alibaba, rounded to 1 decimal place.

However, instead of doing analytics on all Alibaba orders, you have access to a summary table, which describes how many items were in an order (item_count), and the number of orders that had that many items (order_occurrences).

items_per_order Table:
Column Name	        Type
item_count	        integer
order_occurrences	  integer


SELECT 
 ROUND(
  SUM(item_count::DECIMAL * order_occurrences) / SUM(order_occurrences),1) AS mean
FROM 
  items_per_order;
  
 Output

mean
3.9
