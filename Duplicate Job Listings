Assume you are given the table below that shows job postings for all companies on the LinkedIn platform. Write a query to get the number of companies that have posted duplicate job listings.

Clarification:

Duplicate job listings refer to two jobs at the same company with the same title and description.
job_listings Table:
Column Name	Type
job_id	integer
company_id	integer
title	string
description	string


WITH tot_table AS (
  SELECT 
    company_id,
    title,
    description,
    COUNT(job_id) AS num_jobs
  FROM 
    job_listings
  GROUP BY
    company_id,
    title,
    description
    )
SELECT
  COUNT(
    DISTINCT 
      company_id) AS dup_companies
FROM
  tot_table
WHERE
  num_jobs > 1
