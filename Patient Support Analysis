UnitedHealth has a program called Advocate4Me, which allows members to call an advocate and receive support for their health care needs – whether that's behavioural, clinical, well-being, health care financing, benefits, claims or pharmacy help.

Write a query to find how many UHG members made 3 or more calls. case_id column uniquely identifies each call made.

callers Table:
Column Name	        Type
policy_holder_id	  integer
case_id	            varchar
call_category	      varchar
call_received	      timestamp
call_duration_secs	integer
original_order	    integer

Calls to the Advocate4Me call centre are categorised, but sometimes they can't fit neatly into a category. These uncategorised calls are labelled “n/a”, or are just empty (when a support agent enters nothing into the category field).

Write a query to find the percentage of calls that cannot be categorised. Round your answer to 1 decimal place.
