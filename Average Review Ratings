Given the reviews table, write a query to get the average stars for each product every month.

The output should include the month in numerical value, product id, and average star rating rounded to two decimal places. Sort the output based on month followed by the product id.

Column Name	  Type
review_id	    integer

SELECT 
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM submit_date) AS mth,
  product_id AS product,
  ROUND(AVG(stars),2) AS avg_stars
FROM 
  reviews
GROUP BY
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM submit_date),
  product_id
ORDER BY
  mth,
  product_id;
